<span class="dropcap">B</span>aby Pashmina is the finest Pashmina made from the __inner portion of neck__ wool of high mountain goats. The raw wool is refined by hand with a small tool, that gives a very small quantity of Pashmina. The quality of Pashmina depends on the goats of different mountain altitudes, where the goats are reared. Above ten thousand feet higher mountain goats yield best quality Pashmina of less than ten micron thickness, which is considered the best possible Pashmina. Goats at such high altitudes are risky, and cannot rear in large herds due to unavailability of pasture lands. It is possible to rear goats at domestic level only. So a large quantity of Baby Pashmina grade Pashmina is not expected from that type of mountain goats.

The peculiarity of such high altitude goats Pashmina is that it gives more warmness during cold weather than normal Pashmina, though the Pashmina extracting process by hand is no different.
