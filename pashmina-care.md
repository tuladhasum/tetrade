# Pashmina Care

## Quality & Care

We make every effort to ensure the authenticity of shawl fabric – spot testing every batch and asking all providers to guarantee they send us the authentic items we order. In addition, we personally check every single shawl we sell, prior to mailing. In the rare event an item is sent out that is not as described, we will exchange the item or provide a full refund.

## How to care for your Shawl

Your shawl can be carefully hand washed, or in some cases dry cleaned (see care instructions on the label).

*Never place your shawl in a washing machine or dryer.*

## To Hand Wash

Gently hand wash using cold water and a mild detergent soap such as Woolite™ or Ivory™.  A low pH hair shampoo may also be used.
Place shawl on a towel and roll up together to squeeze out excess water.
Place the shawl on a flat surface and lightly stretch it to its original shape.  Allow the shawl to air dry completely.
Once dry, you may lightly press your shawl with a steam iron and use a very soft brush to give the shawl a soft, plush texture.
 

## How to Iron your Shawl

Your shawl should not need a lot of ironing. Just hang it up for few hours and the wrinkles will fall out. If you want to iron:-

Keep your iron at a moderate heat.
DO NOT IRON your shawl directly. Cover it with a thin cloth – a clean damp cloth.
Iron the shawl from one fringed end to the other. Move the iron up and down, not left and right. Use the steamer liberally.
 

## How to store your shawl

Before storing your shawls in basements or attics, check carefully for leaks, dampness and sunlight.

Fold clothes or pack them neatly in tissue paper or plastic bag and store them in closet away from light, dust and dampness.

Cleaning before storage is recommended, as fresh stains that may not yet be visible will oxidize and become fixed during storage, they may also be the food for moths.

To keep moths away, the first important thing is to make sure the shawl is clean before long-time storage. Pay close attention to any food stains as moths are particularly attracted to our normal food proteins and cooking oils. Mothproofing products are helpful, or simply spray some perfume on a piece of paper and put the paper next to your shawl.

## Additional care tips

To keep your shawls always clean and beautiful, here are some basic rules to follow:

Do not wear  next to rough clothing, metal necklaces, bracelets, belts and rough leather items such as crocodile leather bags.
To avoid pilling, it is important not to allow the shawl  to rub against rough clothing, metal accessories, bags and belts.
To remove pills, just manually pick them off. Do not rub or brush your shawl.
