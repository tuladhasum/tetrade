# Cashmere Sweaters

## VAJRA PASHMINA CASHMERE
Vajra Pashmina is made from the fine, soft undercoat of Kashmir goats. We collaborate and partner with the herdsmen who raise them in multi-generational family farm in the Himalayas. The weather environment where these mountain goats are bread is unpredictable with changing temperature. This changeable weather has evolved with goats with longer, loftier, and softer fivers. The goats are sheared once a year during the spring. The purebreds are kept like a pet and are never crossbred for high quality. This tradition has yielded the highest-quality fibers, which are then washed, carded, and spun into two-ply yarns twisted to resist pilling without compromising strength. 

## CARE
* Hand wash cold with mild soap or shampoo
* Use only non-chlorine bleach with needed
* Do not twist or wring
* Reshape and dry flat
* Cool iron if necessary
* Dry clean

## Cashmere
The most precious of natural fibers, cashmere is the fine, soft, downy fleece of the cashmere goat. Renowned for its weightless warmth, cashmere has a sensuous softness and a luxurious hand unparalleled by any other fabric on earth.
