#Stole
A stole is a lady's shawl, especially a formal shawl of expensive fabric used over a party dress or ballgown.

A stole is typically narrower than a shawl, and of simpler construction than a cape; being a length of a quality material, wrapped and carried about the shoulders or arms. Lighter materials such as silk and chiffon are simply finished, that is, cut, hemmed and bound; heavier materials such as fur and brocade are often lined as well.

A stole can also mean a fur or set of furs, (usually fox) worn as a stole with a suit or gown; the pelage of a single animal (head included) is generally used with street dress while for formal wear a finished length of fur using the skins of more than one animal is used; the word stole stands alone or is used in combination: fur stole, mink stole.
